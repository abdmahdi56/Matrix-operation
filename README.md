# Matrix Operation

This project implements basic matrix operations in C, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The program allows users to input two matrices and perform various operations on them.

## Features

- **Matrix Addition**: Adds two matrices of the same dimensions.
- **Matrix Subtraction**: Subtracts one matrix from another of the same dimensions.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiplies two matrices when the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.

## Requirements

- **C Compiler**: Any C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, etc.)
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
